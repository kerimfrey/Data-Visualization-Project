Impact of COVID-19 on football

To say that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the world would be an understatement. In less than a year since the virus emerged — and just over 6 months since tracking began in the the world — it’s brought about some changes in some industries across the globe. One of them is the football.
As the world has gone through a major transformation in the ‘COVID-19, sport in general and football as the most popular mass spectator sport, in particular, has been no exception to this trend.
COVID-19 has posed serious challenges and changes to the sports/soccer world and the responses of various stakeholders from the domain of sport/soccer have been diverse and intriguing across the globe.
Confronting, negotiating and overcoming the challenges posed by the pandemic invited and inspired novel responses and strong improvisations from soccer bodies to players, from referees to spectators, and from journalists to sponsors.
Although there was a complete stoppage of soccer initially almost everywhere across the world in March–April 2020 creating unprecedented confusion about the future of the game with all major leagues being stopped, Euro 2020 postponed and the Summer Olympics deferred, the gradual resumption of games and tournaments from May 2020 onwards began to represent the early impressions and initial responses to the pandemic.
This process has revealed abrupt as well as radical changes in the organization, rules, spectatorship and telecast of the game, thereby affecting its cultural dimensions, commercial prospects and political implications. The way soccer has adjusted to the ‘new normal’ standard of the COVID Regime with quarantine sessions for players and match officials, stadiums without or with minimal spectators, COVID safety protocols for people on the field and in the stadium, and so on has elicited newer meanings and representations of the game.
